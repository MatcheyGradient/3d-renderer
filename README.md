# 3d-renderer
a 3d renderer i made a long time ago with fettuccine code
there's a lot of code in here that may(will) not make sense or is downright bad practice but it works (BARELY ðŸ’€)
If you ever decide to want to use this then change the code in the "out" function in Graph.java to change the y value based on x and z (y is up)
