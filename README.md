# 3d-renderer
a 3d renderer i made a long time ago with fettuccine code  
there's a lot of code in here that may(will) not make sense or is downright bad practice but it works (BARELY ðŸ’€)  
If you ever decide to want to use this then change the code in the "out" function in Graph.java to change the y value based on x and z (y is up)  

The jar that comes with this project has a simple sin function with absolute values to make it look wavy :)
